## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

### What I learned

1. üëâ Radios in the same group (name="...") don‚Äôt each get a separate Tab stop ‚Äî they act as a single control.
You use arrow keys to switch between them. This is expected and correct for accessibility.


2. When trying to make the whole box clickable + keyboard accessible so that when it‚Äôs selected, the background changes (green) and the radio becomes checked.
You need to:

- Use peer on the <input type="radio">

- Use peer-checked: variants on the wrapper or label

```
<fieldset class="query_section">
  <legend class="flex gap-2 pb-2">
    Query Type
    <svg class="w-1.5 h-1.5 fill-[#0c7d69ff]" focusable="false">
      <use xlink:href="#required"></use>
    </svg>
    <span class="sr-only">required</span>
  </legend>

  <div id="inputs_wrapper" class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <!-- General Enquiry -->
    <label
      for="general_enquiry"
      class="flex cursor-pointer items-center gap-2 border border-[#87a3a6ff] rounded-lg p-2 w-full peer-checked:bg-[#dff1e7ff] focus-within:outline-2 focus-within:outline-[#0c7d69ff]"
    >
      <input
        type="radio"
        name="query_type"
        id="general_enquiry"
        class="peer hidden"
      />
      <span>General Enquiry</span>
    </label>

    <!-- Support Request -->
    <label
      for="support_request"
      class="flex cursor-pointer items-center gap-2 border border-[#87a3a6ff] rounded-lg p-2 w-full peer-checked:bg-[#dff1e7ff] focus-within:outline-2 focus-within:outline-[#0c7d69ff]"
    >
      <input
        type="radio"
        name="query_type"
        id="support_request"
        class="peer hidden"
      />
      <span>Support Request</span>
    </label>
  </div>
</fieldset>
```
3. accent-[#0c7d69ff] ‚Üí makes the radio dot green.

4. Key Accessibility Point: aria-live

Screen readers don‚Äôt automatically announce content that appears dynamically (like error messages after form validation).

If you wrap error messages in a container with aria-live="polite", the screen reader will announce them when they appear.

"polite" means: wait until the user has finished speaking before reading the message (so it‚Äôs not disruptive).

üõ† Example: 

```
    <!-- Error message container (hidden initially) -->
    <div id="email_error" class="error" aria-live="polite"></div>
  </div>
```

```
<script>
  const form = document.getElementById("contact_form");
  const emailInput = document.getElementById("email");
  const emailError = document.getElementById("email_error");

  form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault(); // stop form for demo
    emailError.textContent = ""; // reset

    if (!emailInput.value) {
      emailError.textContent = "Email address is required.";
      emailInput.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "true");
    } else if (!emailInput.validity.valid) {
      emailError.textContent = "Please enter a valid email address.";
      emailInput.setAttribute("aria-invalid", "true");
    } else {
      emailInput.removeAttribute("aria-invalid");
      alert("Form submitted!");
    }
  });
</script>
```

üìå Key Accessibility Points

aria-live="polite" ‚Üí announces the error text when it appears.

aria-invalid="true" ‚Üí tells assistive tech the field is currently invalid.

‚úÖ Result:

Sighted users see red text (once you style .error { color: red; }).

Screen reader users hear the message when it appears.

5. To check if form is valid: 

! use case of "some" method !

const isFormValid = () => {
  showError();
  return !Array.from(errorMsgs).some(
    (err) => !err.classList.contains("hidden")
  );
};

6. What does Object.values() do?

It takes an object and returns an array of its values (ignores the keys).

Example:

```
const person = { name: "Farzaneh", age: 28, country: "Iran" };
console.log(Object.values(person));
// üëâ ["Farzaneh", 28, "Iran"]
```

So instead of looping over the keys, you‚Äôre looping over the values directly.

üîç When to use Object.values()?

‚úÖ When you don‚Äôt care about the keys and just need to work with the values.

‚úÖ When your object is more like a dictionary (keys are labels, values are the real data).

‚úÖ Makes iteration cleaner than Object.keys() and then looking up obj[key].
